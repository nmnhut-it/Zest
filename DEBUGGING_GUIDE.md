# Debugging Guide - No Completions Showing

## Issue Description
Breakpoints are hitting in the completion request flow, but no completions are appearing in the editor.

## Root Cause Analysis

Based on the code analysis and logging added, here are the potential issues:

### 1. METHOD_REWRITE Strategy Returns Empty Completion List
When using `CompletionStrategy.METHOD_REWRITE`, the provider returns `ZestInlineCompletionList.EMPTY`. This is intentional because method rewrites show a floating window instead of inline completions.

However, in `handleCompletionResponse`, the code checks:
```kotlin
if (completions == null || completions.isEmpty()) {
    logger.debug("No completions available")
    return
}
```

This causes the flow to exit early without showing anything for METHOD_REWRITE strategy.

### 2. Configuration Check
The service checks if inline completion is enabled:
```kotlin
if (!inlineCompletionEnabled && !manually) {
    logger.debug("Inline completion is disabled, ignoring request")
    return@launch
}
```

Make sure inline completion is enabled in the configuration.

## Debugging Steps with New Logging

The comprehensive logging will show:

1. **Service Initialization**
   - `[ZestInlineCompletion] Initializing service for project: <project_name>`
   - Configuration values (enabled/disabled states)

2. **Completion Request Flow**
   - `[ZestInlineCompletion] provideInlineCompletion called`
   - Request ID generation
   - Mutex acquisition
   - Context building

3. **Provider Strategy**
   - `[ZestCompletionProvider] requestCompletion called with strategy: <strategy>`
   - For METHOD_REWRITE: Should show it returns EMPTY list
   - For SIMPLE: Full LLM interaction details

4. **Response Handling**
   - `[ZestInlineCompletion] handleCompletionResponse called`
   - Whether completions are null/empty
   - Renderer show() calls

5. **Method Rewrite Flow**
   - `[ZestMethodRewrite] rewriteCurrentMethod called`
   - Method context detection
   - Floating window creation

## Expected Log Flow for Different Strategies

### For SIMPLE Strategy:
```
[ZestInlineCompletion] provideInlineCompletion called
[ZestCompletionProvider] requestCompletion called with strategy: SIMPLE
[ZestCompletionProvider] LLM response received
[ZestInlineCompletion] handleCompletionResponse called
[ZestInlineCompletion] Showing completion...
```

### For METHOD_REWRITE Strategy:
```
[ZestInlineCompletion] provideInlineCompletion called
[ZestCompletionProvider] requestCompletion called with strategy: METHOD_REWRITE
[ZestMethodRewrite] rewriteCurrentMethod called
[ZestCompletionProvider] Returning EMPTY completion list
[ZestInlineCompletion] No completions available
```

## Quick Fixes to Try

### 1. Change Strategy to SIMPLE
In your code or configuration, change the strategy:
```kotlin
completionProvider.setStrategy(ZestCompletionProvider.CompletionStrategy.SIMPLE)
```

### 2. Check Configuration
Ensure these are enabled:
- `inlineCompletionEnabled = true`
- `autoTriggerEnabled = true` (for automatic completions)

### 3. Manual Trigger
Try triggering completion manually (with `manually = true`) to bypass auto-trigger checks.

## Where to Look in Logs

1. **No LLM Response**: Check if `[ZestCompletionProvider] LLM response received` appears
2. **Empty Completions**: Look for `No completions available` or `EMPTY completion list`
3. **Configuration Issues**: Check initial `Configuration loaded` messages
4. **Method Not Found**: For METHOD_REWRITE, check if `No method found at cursor position` appears
5. **Renderer Issues**: Look for `Showing completion at offset` followed by success/failure

## Next Steps

1. Run the plugin with the new logging
2. Try to trigger a completion
3. Check the console output for the log messages
4. Identify where in the flow it's failing
5. Share the log output to pinpoint the exact issue

The detailed logging should reveal exactly where the completion flow is breaking down.
