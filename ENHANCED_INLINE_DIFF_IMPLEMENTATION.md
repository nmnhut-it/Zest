# Enhanced Inline Word Diff Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the enhanced inline word diff feature for the Zest plugin.

## Overview

The enhanced diff renderer now provides:
1. **Side-by-side rendering** for modified lines showing `original → modified` format
2. **Word-level diffing** with precise highlighting of changed segments
3. **Code normalization** before diffing (tabs→spaces, trim trailing spaces)
4. **Theme-aware colors** using the editor's color scheme for all text

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **WordDiffUtil** (`src/main/kotlin/com/zps/zest/completion/diff/WordDiffUtil.kt`)
   - Performs word-level diffing on text
   - Normalizes code (converts tabs to spaces, trims trailing whitespace)
   - Tokenizes text into words and whitespace while preserving all characters
   - Merges consecutive segments of the same type for cleaner rendering

2. **ZestInlineMethodDiffRenderer** (Enhanced)
   - Updated `renderLineModification` to show side-by-side diffs
   - Added `createSideBySideDiffRenderer` for word-level highlighting
   - Uses theme-aware colors from `EditorColorsScheme`
   - Properly handles both light and dark themes

### Visual Changes

#### Before (Separate Lines)
```
- old line with changes    // Red strikethrough
+ new line with changes    // Green addition
```

#### After (Side-by-Side with Word Diff)
```
old line with changes → new line with changes
         ^^^^                    ^^^^
    (red background)        (green background)
```

### Color Scheme

The implementation now uses theme-aware colors:

**Light Theme:**
- Deletion background: RGB(255, 220, 220) - subtle red
- Addition background: RGB(220, 255, 228) - subtle green
- Text color: Editor's default foreground

**Dark Theme:**
- Deletion background: RGB(92, 22, 36) - subtle dark red
- Addition background: RGB(15, 83, 35) - subtle dark green
- Text color: Editor's default foreground

### Word-Level Diffing Process

1. **Normalization**: Code is normalized before diffing
   - Tabs converted to 4 spaces
   - Trailing whitespace trimmed from each line
   - Consistent line endings (CRLF → LF)

2. **Tokenization**: Text is split into tokens
   - Words (letters, digits, underscores)
   - Whitespace and punctuation preserved

3. **Diffing**: Uses java-diff-utils library
   - Identifies unchanged, added, deleted, and modified segments
   - Maintains position mapping for accurate rendering

4. **Rendering**: Side-by-side display
   - Original text with strikethrough for deletions/modifications
   - Arrow separator (→)
   - Modified text with highlighting for additions/modifications

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- `WordDiffUtilTest`: Tests word diffing, normalization, and segment merging

### Manual Testing
- `TestEnhancedDiffAction`: Action to manually test the enhanced diff rendering
- Access via: Zest menu → "Test Enhanced Word Diff"

## Usage

The enhanced diff is automatically used when:
1. Method rewrite is triggered
2. Lines are modified (not just added/deleted)
3. The renderer displays side-by-side comparison with word-level highlighting

## Benefits

1. **Clarity**: Easier to see exact changes within a line
2. **Precision**: Word-level highlighting shows specific modifications
3. **Readability**: Theme-aware colors ensure text is always visible
4. **Context**: Side-by-side view maintains spatial awareness

## Future Enhancements

1. **Syntax-aware diffing**: Highlight semantic changes (e.g., method signature changes)
2. **Inline navigation**: Click to jump between changes
3. **Customizable colors**: User preferences for diff colors
4. **Multi-line merging**: Better handling of reformatted code blocks
