# Lean Completion Strategy Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a **LEAN completion strategy** alongside the existing **SIMPLE strategy** for A/B testing. The system now supports two distinct approaches to code completion:

### 1. SIMPLE Strategy (Original)
- **Approach**: FIM (Fill-In-the-Middle) with prefix/suffix context
- **Speed**: Fast (8 seconds timeout, 16 max tokens)
- **Model**: Uses `local-model-mini`
- **Prompt**: Qwen 2.5 Coder FIM format: `<|fim_prefix|>...<|fim_suffix|>...<|fim_middle|>`

### 2. LEAN Strategy (New)
- **Approach**: Full file context with reasoning prompts
- **Speed**: Slower but more intelligent (15 seconds timeout, 1000 max tokens)
- **Model**: Uses `local-model` (full model)
- **Prompt**: Reasoning-based with complete file analysis

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Core Strategy Components

**ZestLeanContextCollector**
- Captures entire file content with `[CURSOR]` marker
- Detects cursor context (method body, class declaration, imports, etc.)
- Provides rich context for AI reasoning

**ZestLeanPromptBuilder**
- Creates reasoning-based prompts tailored to context type
- Includes language-specific guidelines
- Uses structured format: `<reasoning>...</reasoning><code>...</code>`

**ZestLeanResponseParser**
- Extracts reasoning and completion text directly from AI response
- No diff calculation needed - AI generates only the completion
- Validates and cleans completion text for quality

### 2. Strategy Management

**ZestCompletionProvider (Enhanced)**
- Now supports strategy switching via `setStrategy()`
- Routes requests to appropriate strategy components
- Maintains separate timeouts and token limits

**ZestInlineCompletionService (Enhanced)**
- Added `setCompletionStrategy()` and `getCompletionStrategy()` methods
- Enables runtime strategy switching

### 3. A/B Testing Actions

**ZestSwitchStrategyAction**
- Provides easy toggle between SIMPLE and LEAN strategies
- Shows current strategy in action text
- Persists strategy choice in project user data

**ZestTestStrategiesAction**
- Comprehensive testing action for both strategies
- Measures performance, success rate, and completion quality
- Provides detailed comparison reports

## How It Works

### LEAN Strategy Flow

1. **Context Collection**: Captures full file with cursor marker
2. **Reasoning Prompt**: AI analyzes full file context and plans completion
3. **Direct Completion**: AI returns only the completion text (not full file)
4. **Text Cleaning**: Clean and validate the completion text
5. **Completion Display**: Show the completion as inline text

### Example LEAN Prompt

```
You are an expert Java developer. Analyze the following code file and generate the completion text that should be inserted at the [CURSOR] position.

**File: Calculator.java**
**Context: METHOD_BODY**

```java
public class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        [CURSOR]
    }
}
```

**Analysis Instructions:**
- Analyze the method signature and understand its purpose
- Look at existing method implementations for patterns
- Consider what logic would complete this method appropriately

**Task:**
Analyze the full file context and generate ONLY the text that should be inserted at [CURSOR]. Do not return the complete file - just the completion text.

**Response Format:**
<reasoning>
1. **Context Analysis**: The cursor is inside an `add` method that takes two integers
2. **Code Pattern Recognition**: This is a simple arithmetic operation
3. **Completion Strategy**: Return the sum of the two parameters
4. **Related Considerations**: No imports or dependencies needed for this simple case
</reasoning>

<completion>
return a + b;
</completion>
```

### Direct Text Extraction

The parser now extracts completion text directly:
1. **Extract**: `<reasoning>` and `<completion>` sections
2. **Clean**: Remove markdown, explanations, cursor markers
3. **Validate**: Check length, format, and content quality
4. **Return**: Clean completion text ready for insertion

## Usage

### Switching Strategies

**Manual Switch:**
```kotlin
// Via action: "Switch Completion Strategy"
// or programmatically:
val service = project.getService<ZestInlineCompletionService>()
service.setCompletionStrategy(ZestCompletionProvider.CompletionStrategy.LEAN)
```

**Testing Both:**
```kotlin
// Via action: "Test Completion Strategies"
// Runs both strategies and compares results
```

### Strategy Characteristics

| Aspect | SIMPLE | LEAN |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Speed** | ~2-5 seconds | ~5-15 seconds |
| **Context** | Prefix/Suffix only | Full file |
| **Quality** | Good for simple completions | Better for complex logic |
| **Reasoning** | None | Detailed analysis |
| **Tokens** | 16 max | 1000 max |
| **Model** | Mini model | Full model |

## Benefits of LEAN Strategy

1. **Better Context Understanding**: AI sees full file structure
2. **Focused Completions**: Generates only what's needed at cursor
3. **Reasoning Transparency**: Shows AI's thought process
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Learns from existing code patterns
5. **Language Awareness**: Follows language-specific conventions
6. **No Diff Complexity**: Simple, direct completion extraction

## Error Handling & Fallbacks

- **Missing Completion Tags**: Falls back to extracting from `<code>` tags
- **AI Response Parsing Fails**: Returns empty completion
- **Timeout**: Falls back to SIMPLE strategy
- **Invalid Content**: Gracefully handles edge cases
- **Length Limits**: Truncates overly long completions

## Configuration

The system maintains backward compatibility:
- Default strategy: **SIMPLE** (for performance)
- Strategy persisted per project
- Easy switching via actions
- No configuration file changes needed

## Testing & Validation

Use the **ZestTestStrategiesAction** to:
- Compare completion quality
- Measure performance differences  
- Validate reasoning quality
- Test fallback mechanisms

## Future Enhancements

The architecture supports easy addition of:
- More sophisticated diff algorithms
- Context-specific prompt templates
- Multi-turn reasoning conversations
- Strategy auto-selection based on context
- Performance optimization based on usage patterns

## Summary

The LEAN strategy transforms Zest from a simple autocomplete tool into an intelligent coding assistant that understands full context and provides reasoned completions. The A/B testing framework enables data-driven optimization of both approaches.
