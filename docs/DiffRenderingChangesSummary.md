# Summary of Diff Rendering Changes

## Changes Made to Fix Issues

### 1. Fixed Missing Last Line Issue

**In `ZestMethodContextCollector.kt`:**
- Enhanced `findMethodTextually()` to properly calculate method boundaries
- Preserves exact text including trailing newlines
- Added debug logging to track method content and boundaries

**In `ZestInlineMethodDiffRenderer.kt`:**
- Added logic to track processed lines
- Forces rendering of all unprocessed lines, even unchanged ones
- Added `debugMethodBoundaries()` method for detailed logging
- Ensures the complete method is displayed

**In `WordDiffUtil.kt`:**
- Updated `patchToDiffBlocks()` to ensure final blocks include all remaining lines
- Changed type detection for final blocks to properly handle modifications

**In `ZestMethodRewriteService.kt`:**
- Updated `stripTrailingClosingChars()` to preserve trailing newlines

### 2. Fixed Side-by-Side View

**In `ZestInlineMethodDiffRenderer.kt`:**
- Changed to always use `MultiLineDiffRenderer` for modifications (removed single-line special case)
- This ensures all changes are shown in proper side-by-side format

**In `MultiLineDiffRenderer.kt`:**
- Added column headers with "Original" and "Modified" labels
- Added column backgrounds for better visual separation
- Added vertical separator line between columns
- Fixed column width calculations
- Added text clipping with ellipsis for long lines
- Arrow (â†’) now appears on every line for clarity
- Increased padding and spacing for better readability

### 3. Enhanced Debug Capabilities

- Added `DEBUG_DIFF_RENDERING` flag for easier troubleshooting
- Enhanced logging to show:
  - Method boundaries and offsets
  - Character at end offset
  - Missing lines detection
  - Diff block details
  - Unprocessed lines

## Key Improvements

1. **Complete Method Display**: All lines of the method are now shown, including unchanged lines at the end
2. **True Side-by-Side View**: Clear visual separation between original and modified code
3. **Better Visual Design**: 
   - Column headers
   - Background colors for columns
   - Vertical separator
   - Consistent arrow placement
4. **Debug Support**: Comprehensive logging to diagnose issues

## Usage

The diff renderer now:
- Always shows the complete method content
- Uses side-by-side view for all modifications
- Provides clear visual distinction between original and modified code
- Includes all lines, even unchanged ones at the end

## Testing

See `docs/DiffRenderingTestInstructions.md` for detailed testing steps.
