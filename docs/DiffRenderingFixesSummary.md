# Diff Rendering Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Last Line in Diff Display

**Problem**: The last line of methods (especially return statements) wasn't being displayed in the diff visualization.

**Root Causes**:
- Method boundary calculation in `ZestMethodContextCollector` didn't properly preserve trailing newlines
- Diff algorithm might not include unchanged lines at the end of methods
- Off-by-one errors in offset calculations

**Fixes Applied**:
- Enhanced `findMethodTextually()` to properly calculate method boundaries and preserve exact text including trailing newlines
- Added logic in `renderDiffChanges()` to track processed lines and handle missing last lines
- Added debug logging to diagnose boundary issues

### 2. Side-by-Side Alignment Issues in MultiLineDiffRenderer

**Problem**: The multi-line diff renderer had incorrect column calculations and poor alignment.

**Root Causes**:
- Column width calculation `columnWidth - rightColumnX + targetRect.x` resulted in negative values
- No proper column width management for wrapped text
- Arrow only displayed on first segment of wrapped lines

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added `calculateColumnWidth()` method for proper width calculation
- Fixed right column width to use same width as left column
- Improved text wrapping logic

### 3. Enhanced Debug Capabilities

**Added Features**:
- `debugMethodBoundaries()` method for detailed logging of method boundaries and diff blocks
- Debug flag `DEBUG_DIFF_RENDERING` for easier troubleshooting
- Enhanced logging to show missing lines and unchanged content

## Testing

Use the test file `TestMethodDiffRendering.kt` to verify the fixes:

1. **Test Return Statement Display**: 
   - Place cursor in `getUserIdToken` method
   - Trigger method rewrite
   - Verify the return statement line is visible

2. **Test Multi-line Alignment**:
   - Place cursor in `processUserData` method
   - Trigger method rewrite
   - Verify side-by-side columns are properly aligned

3. **Test Complex Formatting**:
   - Place cursor in `buildComplexQuery` method
   - Trigger method rewrite
   - Verify complex multi-line method signatures are handled correctly

## Debug Output

With debug enabled, you'll see output like:
```
=== DEBUG: Method Boundaries ===
Method: getUserIdToken
Method content (with \n visible): 'private String getUserIdToken(Long userId) {\n    if (userId == null) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException("User ID cannot be null");\n    }\n    return leaderboardKey + ":" + userId;\n}'
MISSING LINES: Last diff block covers up to line 3, but method has 5 lines
```

This helps identify when lines are missing from the diff display.
