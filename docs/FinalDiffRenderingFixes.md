# Final Summary: Complete Diff Rendering Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing Last Line (Root Cause: Diff Algorithm)
**Problem**: The diff algorithm was returning DELETED and ADDED blocks separately instead of MODIFIED blocks, causing incomplete rendering.

**Solution**:
- Added `mergeDeleteInsertBlocks()` in `WordDiffUtil` to merge consecutive DELETE+INSERT into MODIFIED
- Removed line normalization to preserve exact text
- Enhanced debug logging to track block types

### 2. ✅ Side-by-Side View Not Showing
**Problem**: Single-line modifications were rendered inline with arrow instead of side-by-side.

**Solution**:
- Changed `ZestInlineMethodDiffRenderer` to always use `MultiLineDiffRenderer` for all modifications
- Removed the single-line special case

### 3. ✅ Visual Improvements
**Enhanced `MultiLineDiffRenderer`**:
- Added column headers ("Original" and "Modified")
- Added column backgrounds for visual separation
- Added vertical separator line
- Fixed column width calculations
- Added text clipping with ellipsis
- Arrow (→) on every line

### 4. ✅ Method Boundary Detection
**Enhanced `ZestMethodContextCollector`**:
- Improved offset calculations to preserve trailing newlines
- Added debug logging for boundary detection
- More accurate method content extraction

## Key Code Changes

### WordDiffUtil.kt
```kotlin
// 1. Removed normalization in diffLines()
val patch = DiffUtils.diff(originalLines, modifiedLines, diffAlgorithm)

// 2. Added merge logic
private fun mergeDeleteInsertBlocks(blocks: List<DiffBlock>): List<DiffBlock> {
    // Merges DELETE+INSERT → MODIFIED
}
```

### ZestInlineMethodDiffRenderer.kt
```kotlin
// Always use multi-line renderer for modifications
when (block.type) {
    WordDiffUtil.BlockType.MODIFIED -> {
        renderMultiLineBlock(context, block, blockStartInDocument)
    }
}
```

### MultiLineDiffRenderer.kt
- Column headers with gray background
- Visual column separation
- Proper text clipping
- Enhanced spacing and padding

## Result

The diff renderer now:
1. **Shows all lines** including unchanged ones at the end
2. **Uses side-by-side view** for all changes
3. **Properly merges** DELETE+INSERT into MODIFIED blocks
4. **Provides clear visual separation** between original and modified code

## Testing

1. Use any method with a return statement at the end
2. Trigger method rewrite
3. Verify:
   - All lines are visible (including the last return statement)
   - Changes show in side-by-side format
   - Column headers and visual separation
   - No missing lines

## Debug Output Example
```
=== Merging DELETE/INSERT blocks ===
Original blocks: 5
  DELETED: lines 1-1 -> 0-0
  ADDED: lines 0-0 -> 1-1
  DELETED: lines 2-2 -> 0-0
  ADDED: lines 0-0 -> 2-2
  UNCHANGED: lines 4-4 -> 4-4
Merging DELETE (1-1) + INSERT (1-1) -> MODIFIED
Merging DELETE (2-2) + INSERT (2-2) -> MODIFIED
Merged blocks: 3
```

The diff now correctly identifies modifications and renders them properly!
