# Ghost Text Overlap Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The ghost text (suggested code changes) was overlapping with existing code in the editor, making it difficult to read and understand the diff. Specifically, the new return statement was being rendered on top of the existing method signature.

## Root Causes

1. **Incorrect Inlay Positioning**: The ghost text inlay was being placed at the start of the current line (`getLineStartOffset`) instead of after the previous line (`getLineEndOffset`).

2. **Line Offset Miscalculation**: The diff renderer was not correctly tracking the position within the document, causing additions to be placed at wrong locations.

3. **Insufficient Background Clearing**: The ghost text renderer wasn't clearing enough background area, allowing text to overlap.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Inlay Positioning

Changed from:
```kotlin
val insertOffset = document.getLineStartOffset(actualLineNumber)
```

To:
```kotlin
val insertOffset = if (actualLineNumber > 0) {
    document.getLineEndOffset(actualLineNumber - 1)  // After previous line
} else {
    0  // Beginning of document
}
```

### 2. Improved Line Tracking

- Removed confusing `currentOriginalLine` accumulator
- Use block positions directly from diff result
- Calculate insertion points based on the block's context

### 3. Enhanced Rendering

- Use full editor width for ghost text background
- Enable antialiasing for smoother text
- Add proper padding and spacing
- Clear background completely before rendering

### 4. Added Debug Support

Created `DiffDebugUtil` for troubleshooting:
- Log diff block details
- Validate line positions
- Create visual diff representation

## Key Changes

1. **renderLineAddition**: Now correctly positions additions after the previous line
2. **renderDiffChanges**: Better tracking of document positions
3. **Ghost text renderers**: Full-width background clearing
4. **Debug logging**: Better visibility into diff operations

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works correctly:

1. Trigger a method rewrite that adds new lines
2. Check that ghost text appears in clean space, not overlapping
3. Verify proper spacing between original and added content
4. Test edge cases (beginning/end of method, multi-line additions)

## Configuration

If issues persist, adjust these settings:

```kotlin
// In DiffRenderingConfig
multiLineThreshold = 1  // Use block rendering for 2+ lines
enableWordLevelDiff = true  // Enable word-level highlighting
diffAlgorithm = "HISTOGRAM"  // Better for code diffs
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Smart insertion point detection**: Analyze code structure to find optimal insertion points
2. **Syntax-aware rendering**: Use PSI tree for more accurate positioning
3. **Animated transitions**: Smooth animations when showing/hiding diffs
4. **Inline preview mode**: Show changes inline without ghost text for simpler diffs
