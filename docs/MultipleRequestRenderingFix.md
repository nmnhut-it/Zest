# Multiple Request and Rendering Fix

## Problem Summary
The plugin was experiencing issues with:
1. Multiple concurrent completion requests being sent to the server
2. Multiple completions being rendered simultaneously, causing visual glitches
3. Race conditions between different completion requests
4. Interference between new requests and existing completions

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Lack of Request Tracking**
- No way to identify which request a response belonged to
- Old responses could be rendered after newer requests were made
- No mechanism to cancel outdated requests

### 2. **Debouncing Issues**
- Multiple document changes within the debounce window would each schedule their own completion
- No single timer to manage debouncing properly

### 3. **Missing Synchronization**
- Critical sections weren't protected, allowing concurrent modifications
- Real-time overlap handling could create new jobs while others were running
- No mutex protection for rendering operations

### 4. **Renderer State Management**
- Renderer didn't always clear previous renderings completely
- Error handling could leave partial renderings visible
- Current state wasn't cleared immediately on hide()

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. **Request Generation Tracking**
Added atomic request ID tracking to both services:

```kotlin
// In ZestInlineCompletionService
private val requestGeneration = AtomicInteger(0)
private var activeRequestId: Int? = null

// In ZestMethodRewriteService  
private val rewriteRequestId = AtomicInteger(0)
private var activeRewriteId: Int? = null
```

Each new request gets a unique ID, and responses are ignored if they belong to outdated requests.

### 2. **Mutex-Based Synchronization**
Added mutexes to protect critical sections:

```kotlin
// In ZestInlineCompletionService
private val completionMutex = Mutex()

// In ZestMethodRewriteService
private val rewriteMutex = Mutex()
```

Key operations now use `mutex.withLock` to ensure only one operation proceeds at a time.

### 3. **Single Timer Debouncing**
Improved debouncing with a single timer:

```kotlin
private var completionTimer: Job? = null

private fun scheduleNewCompletion(editor: Editor) {
    // Cancel any existing timer
    completionTimer?.cancel()
    
    // Don't schedule if a request is already active
    if (activeRequestId != null) {
        return
    }
    
    completionTimer = scope.launch {
        delay(AUTO_TRIGGER_DELAY_MS)
        // Check again before triggering
        if (currentCompletion == null && activeRequestId == null) {
            // Trigger completion
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. **Enhanced Renderer State Management**
Improved the renderer to:
- Always call hide() before showing new completions
- Clear current reference immediately in hide() to prevent re-entry
- Add error handling for each inlay/markup disposal
- Add isActive() method for state checking

```kotlin
fun hide() {
    val context = current
    current = null // Clear immediately
    
    context?.let { 
        // Dispose with error handling for each item
    }
}
```

### 5. **Request Lifecycle Improvements**

#### For Inline Completions:
1. Generate request ID
2. Check if request is still latest before processing
3. Clear any existing completion before starting new one
4. Use mutex to process response
5. Check request validity multiple times during processing
6. Clear active request ID when done

#### For Method Rewrites:
1. Generate request ID
2. Use mutex for entire operation
3. Check request validity after each async operation
4. Clear renderer before showing new diff
5. Clean up state properly on completion

### 6. **Real-Time Overlap Handling**
Improved to prevent multiple concurrent jobs:

```kotlin
private fun handleRealTimeOverlap(editor: Editor, event: DocumentEvent) {
    // Don't create new jobs if one is already running
    if (currentCompletionJob?.isActive == true) {
        return
    }
    // ... rest of handling
}
```

## Key Benefits

1. **No More Duplicate Requests**: Request ID tracking ensures only the latest request is processed
2. **No More Multiple Renderings**: Mutex protection and proper hide() calls prevent overlapping renderings
3. **Better Performance**: Single timer debouncing reduces unnecessary processing
4. **More Stable UI**: Proper state management prevents visual glitches
5. **Race Condition Prevention**: Synchronization ensures operations don't interfere with each other

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Rapid Typing Test**: Type quickly and verify only one completion appears
2. **Multiple Request Test**: Trigger multiple completions rapidly and verify only the last one renders
3. **Cancel Test**: Start a completion and immediately move cursor - verify it's cancelled properly
4. **Error Resilience**: Test with disposed editors to ensure error handling works
5. **Method Rewrite Test**: Trigger multiple method rewrites and verify only one proceeds

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding request cancellation tokens for finer control
2. Add metrics to track request/response timing
3. Consider implementing request queuing for better control
4. Add visual indicators for request state (loading, processing, etc.)
