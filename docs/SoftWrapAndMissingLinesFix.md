# Soft Wrap and Missing Lines Fix

## Changes Made

### 1. Soft Wrapping Instead of Truncation
- Removed `clipTextToWidth()` function that was truncating lines with "..."
- Enhanced `wrapLine()` to always wrap long lines at word boundaries
- Lines now wrap with proper continuation indent

### 2. Unified Rendering for All Block Types
- ADDED blocks now use `MultiLineDiffRenderer` with empty left column
- DELETED blocks now use `MultiLineDiffRenderer` with empty right column
- UNCHANGED blocks are now rendered to ensure complete method visibility
- All blocks use the same side-by-side rendering for consistency

### 3. Improved Column Width Calculation
- Adjusted column width calculation to provide more space
- Each column gets ~45% of editor width
- Proper spacing for arrow and separators

### 4. Enhanced Debug Logging
- Added coverage analysis to track which lines are covered by diff blocks
- Detailed logging of processed vs unprocessed lines
- Block-by-block processing information

## How It Works

### Before (Issues):
1. Long lines were truncated with "..."
2. Some blocks (UNCHANGED, ADDED) were not rendered
3. Missing lines at the end of methods

### After (Fixed):
1. Long lines soft-wrap with continuation indent:
   ```
   Original                        Modified
   ────────────────────────────────────────────
   if (userId == null) {       →   if (userId == null || userId < 0) {
   throw new IllegalArgument   →   throw new IllegalArgumentException(
     Exception("User ID cann   →     "User ID cannot be null or negat
     ot be null");             →     ive");
   ```

2. All blocks are rendered in side-by-side view:
   - MODIFIED: Both columns show content
   - ADDED: Left column empty, right shows new content
   - DELETED: Left shows content, right column empty
   - UNCHANGED: Both columns show same content

3. Complete method visibility ensured by:
   - Rendering all diff blocks including UNCHANGED
   - Processing any unprocessed lines after diff
   - Proper line tracking

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. **Long Line Wrapping**: 
   - Create a method with very long lines
   - Trigger diff - lines should wrap, not truncate

2. **Complete Method Display**:
   - Ensure all lines including closing braces are visible
   - Check that unchanged lines at the end appear

3. **Added Lines**:
   - Add new lines to a method
   - They should appear with empty left column

## Key Code Changes

```kotlin
// Always render unchanged blocks
WordDiffUtil.BlockType.UNCHANGED -> {
    logger.debug("Processing ${block.originalLines.size} unchanged lines")
    renderMultiLineBlock(context, block, blockStartInDocument)
}

// Soft wrap instead of clip
val wrappedOriginal = wrapLines(originalLines, leftFont, columnWidth - PADDING, leftMetrics)
// No more clipTextToWidth!
```

The diff renderer now shows the complete method with all changes properly aligned and wrapped.
