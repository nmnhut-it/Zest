# Cocos2d-x Method Extraction Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to the Zest plugin's method extraction functionality to better support Cocos2d-x JavaScript/TypeScript projects.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Enhanced Method Declaration Detection
**Problem**: The original regex patterns for JavaScript/TypeScript were not catching all Cocos2d-x method patterns, particularly object literal methods and various function declaration styles.

**Solution**: Enhanced `isMethodDeclaration()` to support:
- Traditional function declarations: `function name() {}`
- Variable functions with const/let/var: `const name = function() {}`
- Arrow functions: `const name = () => {}`
- Arrow functions without parentheses: `const name = arg => {}`
- Async functions: `async function name() {}` and `const name = async () => {}`
- Object literal methods: `methodName: function() {}`
- Object methods with arrow functions: `methodName: () => {}`
- ES6 class methods: `methodName() {}`
- Generator functions: `function* name() {}`
- Class methods in extend patterns with optional trailing commas
- All combinations with const, let, and var

### 2. String-Aware Brace Counting
**Problem**: The method boundary detection was counting braces inside strings and comments, leading to incorrect method end detection.

**Solution**: Implemented `findMethodEndWithStringAwareness()` that:
- Tracks string state (single quotes, double quotes, template literals)
- Handles escape sequences properly
- Ignores braces in single-line and multi-line comments
- Provides accurate method boundary detection

### 3. Improved Language Detection
**Problem**: TypeScript files were being misidentified as "textmate" by IntelliJ.

**Solution**: Created `detectLanguage()` method that:
- Checks file extensions first before relying on file type
- Properly identifies TypeScript (.ts, .tsx) files
- Supports a wide range of programming languages
- Falls back to file type detection only when extension is unknown

### 4. Better Method Name Extraction
**Problem**: Method name extraction was failing for object literal methods and various function patterns common in JavaScript.

**Solution**: Enhanced `extractMethodName()` to try patterns in order of specificity:
- Object literal methods: `methodName: function(`
- Arrow methods: `methodName: () =>`
- Regular functions: `function methodName(`
- Variable functions: `const/let/var methodName = function(`
- Variable arrow functions: `const/let/var methodName = () =>`
- ES6 class methods: `methodName(`
- Generator functions: `function* methodName(`
- All async variants

### 5. Method Validation
**Problem**: No validation was performed on extracted methods, leading to incomplete or invalid extractions.

**Solution**: Added `validateExtractedMethod()` that checks:
- Brace balance (accounting for strings)
- Valid method signature presence
- Cocos2d-x specific patterns and best practices
- Provides warnings for common issues

### 6. Enhanced Context Detection
**Problem**: Simple method detection didn't consider surrounding context.

**Solution**: Implemented `isEnhancedMethodDeclaration()` that:
- Checks if we're inside an extend block or object literal
- Uses more lenient patterns for object methods when in appropriate context
- Improves accuracy for Cocos2d-x pattern detection

### 7. Multi-line Signature Support
**Problem**: Method signatures that span multiple lines were not properly extracted.

**Solution**: Enhanced `extractMethodSignature()` to:
- Look ahead for complete signatures when parameters span multiple lines
- Handle complex function signatures with default parameters, destructuring, etc.
- Support all modern JavaScript/TypeScript syntax patterns

## Code Examples

### Before (Would Not Detect)
```javascript
// These patterns were not properly detected:

const myFunction = function(param) {
    return param * 2;
};

let arrowFunc = (x, y) => {
    return x + y;
};

var oldStyleFunc = function() {
    console.log("Old style");
};

const multilineFunc = function(
    param1,
    param2
) {
    return param1 + param2;
};
```

### After (All Properly Detected)
All JavaScript/TypeScript function patterns are now properly detected:
- All const/let/var function assignments
- Arrow functions with and without parentheses
- Async and generator functions
- Multi-line signatures
- Object literal methods in extend blocks
- Methods with strings containing braces
- Methods with trailing commas

## Supported Patterns

The improved method extraction now supports:

1. **Traditional Functions**
   - `function name() {}`
   - `async function name() {}`
   - `function* generator() {}`

2. **Variable Functions**
   - `const name = function() {}`
   - `let name = function() {}`
   - `var name = function() {}`
   - `const name = async function() {}`
   - `const name = function*() {}`

3. **Arrow Functions**
   - `const name = () => {}`
   - `const name = (x, y) => {}`
   - `const name = x => {}`
   - `const name = async () => {}`
   - `const name = async x => {}`

4. **Object Methods**
   - `methodName: function() {}`
   - `methodName: () => {}`
   - `methodName: x => {}`
   - `methodName() {}` (ES6 shorthand)

5. **Class Methods**
   - `methodName() {}`
   - `static methodName() {}`
   - `async methodName() {}`
   - `constructor() {}`

6. **Complex Patterns**
   - Multi-line signatures
   - Methods with default parameters
   - Methods with destructuring
   - Methods with rest parameters
   - Nested functions

## Testing
Created test files to verify the improvements:
- `test/cocos_test.js` - JavaScript Cocos2d-x patterns
- `test/cocos_test.ts` - TypeScript Cocos2d-x patterns
- `test/js_function_patterns_test.js` - Comprehensive JavaScript patterns
- Unit tests in `ZestMethodContextCollectorTest.kt`

## Benefits
1. **Comprehensive Pattern Support**: All modern JavaScript/TypeScript function patterns are supported
2. **Accurate Method Extraction**: const/let/var functions are reliably detected
3. **Better Error Handling**: String and comment aware parsing prevents false boundaries
4. **TypeScript Support**: Proper language detection for TypeScript files
5. **Validation**: Methods are validated after extraction
6. **Context Awareness**: Better detection based on surrounding code context

## Future Improvements
1. Add support for more exotic JavaScript patterns
2. Implement AST-based parsing for languages that support it
3. Add more comprehensive validation rules
4. Support for JSDoc comment extraction
5. Better handling of nested functions and closures
