# Cocos2d-x Method Extraction Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to the Zest plugin's method extraction functionality to better support Cocos2d-x JavaScript/TypeScript projects.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Enhanced Method Declaration Detection
**Problem**: The original regex patterns for JavaScript/TypeScript were not catching all Cocos2d-x method patterns, particularly object literal methods and various function declaration styles.

**Solution**: Enhanced `isMethodDeclaration()` to support:
- Traditional function declarations: `function name() {}`
- Variable functions with const/let/var: `const name = function() {}`
- Object property assignments: `x.y = function() {}` and `x.y.z = function() {}`
- Arrow functions: `const name = () => {}`
- Arrow functions without parentheses: `const name = arg => {}`
- Async functions: `async function name() {}` and `const name = async () => {}`
- Object literal methods: `methodName: function() {}`
- Object methods with arrow functions: `methodName: () => {}`
- ES6 class methods: `methodName() {}`
- Generator functions: `function* name() {}`
- TypeScript methods with return types: `method(): ReturnType {}`
- Class methods in extend patterns with optional trailing commas
- All combinations with const, let, and var

### 2. String-Aware Brace Counting
**Problem**: The method boundary detection was counting braces inside strings and comments, leading to incorrect method end detection.

**Solution**: Implemented `findMethodEndWithStringAwareness()` that:
- Tracks string state (single quotes, double quotes, template literals)
- Handles escape sequences properly
- Ignores braces in single-line and multi-line comments
- Provides accurate method boundary detection

### 3. Improved Language Detection
**Problem**: TypeScript files were being misidentified as "textmate" by IntelliJ.

**Solution**: Created `detectLanguage()` method that:
- Checks file extensions first before relying on file type
- Properly identifies TypeScript (.ts, .tsx) files
- Supports a wide range of programming languages
- Falls back to file type detection only when extension is unknown

### 4. Better Method Name Extraction
**Problem**: Method name extraction was failing for object literal methods and various function patterns common in JavaScript.

**Solution**: Enhanced `extractMethodName()` to try patterns in order of specificity:
- Object literal methods: `methodName: function(`
- Object property methods: `x.y = function(` extracts "y"
- Arrow methods: `methodName: () =>`
- Regular functions: `function methodName(`
- Variable functions: `const/let/var methodName = function(`
- Variable arrow functions: `const/let/var methodName = () =>`
- ES6 class methods: `methodName(`
- Generator functions: `function* methodName(`
- All async variants

### 5. Method Validation
**Problem**: No validation was performed on extracted methods, leading to incomplete or invalid extractions.

**Solution**: Added `validateExtractedMethod()` that checks:
- Brace balance (accounting for strings)
- Valid method signature presence
- Cocos2d-x specific patterns and best practices
- Provides warnings for common issues

### 6. Enhanced Context Detection
**Problem**: Simple method detection didn't consider surrounding context.

**Solution**: Implemented `isEnhancedMethodDeclaration()` that:
- Checks if we're inside an extend block or object literal
- Uses more lenient patterns for object methods when in appropriate context
- Improves accuracy for Cocos2d-x pattern detection

### 7. Multi-line Signature Support
**Problem**: Method signatures that span multiple lines were not properly extracted.

**Solution**: Enhanced `extractMethodSignature()` to:
- Look ahead for complete signatures when parameters span multiple lines
- Handle complex function signatures with default parameters, destructuring, etc.
- Support all modern JavaScript/TypeScript syntax patterns

### 8. Selected Text Support
**Problem**: Users had to position cursor inside a method for detection, which sometimes failed for complex patterns.

**Solution**: Added `createMethodContextFromSelection()` that:
- Checks if user has selected text in the editor
- Uses the selected text as the method content directly
- No method boundary detection needed - selection IS the method
- Allows users to select any code block for rewriting
- Particularly useful for partial method rewrites or non-standard patterns

### 9. TypeScript Return Type Support
**Problem**: TypeScript methods with return type annotations were not properly detected.

**Solution**: Added patterns to detect:
- Regular methods with return types: `method(): ReturnType {}`
- Arrow functions with return types: `method: (): ReturnType => {}`
- Complex return types with generics: `method(): Promise<Data[]> {}`

## Code Examples

### Before (Would Not Detect)
```javascript
// These patterns were not properly detected:

MyApp.init = function() {
    console.log("Initializing");
};

GameLayer.prototype.update = function(dt) {
    this.rotation += dt * 60;
};

module.exports.handler = function(req, res) {
    res.send("Hello");
};

// TypeScript with return type
getConfig(): GameConfig {
    return this.config;
}
```

### After (All Properly Detected)
All JavaScript/TypeScript function patterns are now properly detected:
- All const/let/var function assignments
- Object property methods: `x.y = function() {}`
- Deeply nested: `x.y.z = function() {}`
- Prototype methods: `Class.prototype.method = function() {}`
- Module exports: `exports.method = function() {}`
- TypeScript return types
- Selected text (any selection)

## Supported Patterns

The improved method extraction now supports:

1. **Traditional Functions**
   - `function name() {}`
   - `async function name() {}`
   - `function* generator() {}`

2. **Variable Functions**
   - `const name = function() {}`
   - `let name = function() {}`
   - `var name = function() {}`
   - `const name = async function() {}`
   - `const name = function*() {}`

3. **Object Property Functions**
   - `obj.method = function() {}`
   - `obj.prop.method = function() {}`
   - `MyClass.prototype.method = function() {}`
   - `module.exports.method = function() {}`
   - `window.globalMethod = function() {}`

4. **Arrow Functions**
   - `const name = () => {}`
   - `obj.method = () => {}`
   - `const name = async () => {}`
   - All variations with object properties

5. **TypeScript Specific**
   - `method(): ReturnType {}`
   - `method: (param: Type): ReturnType => {}`
   - `async method(): Promise<Type> {}`

6. **Selected Text**
   - Any selected text is treated as method content
   - No boundary detection needed
   - Useful for partial rewrites

## Usage

### Method Detection
1. Place cursor inside any supported method pattern
2. Run "Trigger Block Rewrite" action
3. Method is automatically detected and extracted

### Selected Text Mode
1. Select any portion of code
2. Run "Trigger Block Rewrite" action
3. Selected text is used as the method content
4. No method detection performed - selection is the method

## Testing
Created test files to verify the improvements:
- `test/cocos_test.js` - JavaScript Cocos2d-x patterns
- `test/cocos_test.ts` - TypeScript Cocos2d-x patterns
- `test/js_function_patterns_test.js` - Comprehensive JavaScript patterns
- `test/object_property_methods_test.js` - Object property patterns
- `test/selection_test.js` - Selected text feature examples
- Unit tests in `ZestMethodContextCollectorTest.kt`

## Benefits
1. **Comprehensive Pattern Support**: All modern JavaScript/TypeScript function patterns are supported
2. **Object Property Methods**: Full support for `x.y = function` patterns
3. **Selected Text Mode**: Users can select any code for rewriting
4. **TypeScript Support**: Proper handling of return type annotations
5. **Accurate Method Extraction**: All patterns reliably detected
6. **Better Error Handling**: String and comment aware parsing
7. **Validation**: Methods are validated after extraction
8. **Context Awareness**: Better detection based on surrounding code

## Future Improvements
1. Add support for more exotic JavaScript patterns
2. Implement AST-based parsing for languages that support it
3. Add more comprehensive validation rules
4. Support for JSDoc comment extraction
5. Better handling of nested functions and closures
6. Support for decorators and metadata
