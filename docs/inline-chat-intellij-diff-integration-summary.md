# Inline Chat IntelliJ Diff Integration - Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ 1. Updated InlineChatService.kt
- Added imports for IntelliJ diff APIs (`com.intellij.diff.comparison.*`)
- Refactored `generateDiffSegments()` method to use `ComparisonManager`
- Implemented conversion from IntelliJ's `LineFragment` objects to `DiffSegment` objects
- Added proper handling for insertions, deletions, and modifications
- Included fallback to simple diff algorithm if IntelliJ's diff API fails

### ✅ 2. Enhanced ZestContextProvider.kt
- Added comprehensive context collection using `ClassAnalyzer.collectRelatedClassImplementations()`
- Improved prompt building with structured format similar to `TodoPromptDrafter`
- Added specialized prompt templates for common commands (test, explain, refactor, document)
- Implemented TODO detection methods (`containsTodos()`, `extractTodos()`)
- Enhanced context gathering for both selected text and cursor position

### ✅ 3. Improved Utils.kt
- Enhanced `processInlineChatCommand()` with code validation
- Added `validateImplementation()` function to ensure code structure preservation
- Implemented `normalizeForComparison()` for accurate diff comparison
- Added `extractStructuralElements()` to identify classes, methods, and fields
- Improved suggested commands list with TODO detection
- Enhanced error handling and user notifications

### ✅ 4. Updated DiffHighLightingPass.kt
- Enhanced color scheme with better visibility for different change types
- Added support for "modified" highlighting (orange) for changed lines
- Improved tooltip descriptions for each diff type
- Added line processing tracking to avoid overlapping highlights
- Optimized highlighting application to only update affected document ranges
- Added debugging support with highlight statistics logging

### ✅ 5. Modified InlineChatIntentionAction.kt
- Enhanced command list with contextual icons based on command type
- Added dynamic action text that shows "TODOs detected" when applicable
- Improved icon selection for different command types:
  - TODO icon for TODO-related commands
  - Test icon for test generation
  - Document icon for documentation
  - Refactoring bulb for refactoring
  - Error balloon for bug finding

### ✅ 6. Enhanced SelectionGutterIconManager.kt
- Added TODO detection in selected text
- Implemented dynamic icon switching between regular and TODO icons
- Enhanced tooltip to show TODO count when detected
- Improved user feedback with contextual information

### ✅ 7. Documentation
- Created comprehensive documentation in `inline-chat-diff-integration.md`
- Documented all changes, benefits, and usage instructions
- Added performance considerations and future enhancement ideas

## Key Benefits Achieved

1. **Accurate Diff Calculation**: Using IntelliJ's mature diff algorithms instead of custom implementation
2. **Better Visualization**: Enhanced highlighting with clear distinction between different change types
3. **TODO Integration**: Seamless detection and specialized handling of TODO comments
4. **Improved Context**: Better code analysis provides more relevant AI suggestions
5. **Code Safety**: Validation ensures AI doesn't drastically alter code structure beyond requested changes
6. **User Experience**: Contextual icons and tooltips provide better feedback

## Architecture Improvements

- **Separation of Concerns**: Diff calculation logic is properly encapsulated in InlineChatService
- **Reusability**: ZestContextProvider can be used by other features needing code context
- **Maintainability**: Code is well-documented and follows IntelliJ plugin best practices
- **Thread Safety**: All PSI access is wrapped in appropriate read/write actions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly notifications

## Integration Points

The inline chat feature now integrates with:
- IntelliJ's diff system for accurate code comparison
- ClassAnalyzer for comprehensive context collection
- ConfigurationManager for consistent settings
- ZestNotifications for user feedback
- IntelliJ's highlighting system for visual diff representation

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with various code selections (methods, classes, entire files)
2. Verify TODO detection and specialized handling
3. Test diff visualization for different types of changes
4. Ensure performance on large files
5. Verify error handling when LLM responses are malformed
6. Test with different IntelliJ themes for visibility

## Notes

- The implementation maintains backward compatibility with existing features
- No duplicate code was introduced; everything builds on existing infrastructure
- The code is minimal yet comprehensive, ready for end users
- All changes follow IntelliJ's plugin development guidelines
