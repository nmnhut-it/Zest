# RAG System Enhancements

## What's New

### 1. Enhanced Signature Extraction

The RAG system now captures much more information from your codebase:

#### Interfaces
- Previously: Interfaces were skipped
- Now: All interfaces are indexed with their methods and documentation

#### Javadoc Documentation
- Previously: Only signatures were captured
- Now: Complete javadoc documentation is indexed and searchable

#### Additional Type Information
- Generic type parameters and bounds
- Exception declarations (throws clauses)
- All modifiers (volatile, transient, synchronized)

### 2. New Project Mode

A new browser mode that provides enhanced project understanding:

- **Automatic Knowledge Integration**: Your project's RAG knowledge is automatically included in every chat
- **No Manual Context Needed**: The AI has immediate access to your entire codebase
- **Project-Specific Responses**: Get suggestions that match your project's patterns and conventions

## Migration Guide

### Re-index Your Project

To benefit from the enhanced indexing, you need to re-index your project:

1. Right-click in the editor → Zest → "Index Project for RAG"
2. Or use the Knowledge Base Manager and click "Re-index"

The new indexing will capture:
- All interfaces (previously skipped)
- Javadoc documentation
- Enhanced type information

### Using Project Mode

1. After re-indexing, select "Project Mode" from the mode dropdown
2. Start chatting - the AI automatically has access to your codebase
3. No need to use the `search_project_code` tool manually

## Technical Details

### Enhanced Metadata Structure

Each signature now includes additional metadata:

```json
{
  "type": "interface",
  "name": "UserRepository",
  "qualifiedName": "com.example.UserRepository",
  "package": "com.example",
  "isInterface": true,
  "javadoc": "Repository for user operations.\nProvides CRUD operations.",
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Improved Document Format

The indexed documents now have better structure:

```markdown
## Interfaces
### `com.example.UserRepository`

Repository for user operations.
Provides CRUD operations.

```java
public interface UserRepository<T extends User>
```

## Methods
- `com.example.UserRepository#findById`
  
  Finds a user by their ID.
  @param id the user ID
  @return the user or null
  ```java
  public T findById(Long id)
  ```
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Code Understanding**: The AI now understands your interfaces and contracts
2. **Documentation-Aware**: Javadoc helps the AI understand the purpose and usage of code
3. **Improved Suggestions**: With full type information, suggestions are more accurate
4. **Easier Usage**: Project Mode eliminates the need for manual context management

## Compatibility

- The enhanced indexing is backward compatible
- Existing indexed projects will continue to work
- Re-indexing will add the new information without disrupting existing functionality

## Known Limitations

- Currently only supports Java (Kotlin support coming soon)
- Large projects may take longer to index due to additional information
- Javadoc formatting is preserved but may need cleanup in some cases
