# Zest Inline Completion Implementation Progress

## Overview
Implementation of inline code completion feature for Zest IntelliJ plugin following the 8-week plan.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2) ✅ COMPLETED

### Completed ✅
- [x] Create basic data models (ZestInlineCompletionItem, ZestInlineCompletionList, CompletionContext)
- [x] Create `ZestInlineCompletionService` with core functionality
- [x] Implement basic `ZestInlineCompletionRenderer` for displaying completions
- [x] Set up document change listeners (ZestDocumentListener, ZestCaretListener)
- [x] Integrate with existing `LLMService` via ZestCompletionProvider
- [x] Create ZestCompletionProcessor for response validation
- [x] Set up ZestEditorFactoryListener for event management
- [x] Create startup activity for service initialization
- [x] Add utility functions for safe message bus publishing
- [x] Create plugin.xml configuration
- [x] Add basic unit tests
- [x] Document Phase 1 implementation

### Notes
- Phase 1 completed successfully with full LLM integration
- All core infrastructure components implemented and tested
- Ready to proceed to Phase 2: Action System

### Notes
- Starting implementation on [current date]
- Following Tabby plugin patterns for best practices

## Phase 2: Action System (Week 3) ✅ COMPLETED

### Completed ✅
- [x] Implement `ZestInlineCompletionAction` base class
- [x] Create action promoter for priority handling
- [x] Implement basic trigger action
- [x] Add accept/dismiss actions
- [x] Test basic completion flow
- [x] Create all action types (Accept, Dismiss, TabAccept, Cycle, Partial Accept)
- [x] Set up keyboard shortcuts in plugin.xml
- [x] Add comprehensive action system tests
- [x] Integrate with ZestInlineCompletionService

### Action System Components ✅
- **ZestInlineCompletionAction**: Base class for all completion actions with priority support
- **ZestActionPromoter**: Ensures Zest actions take precedence over other actions
- **ZestTrigger**: Manual completion trigger (Ctrl+Space, Alt+/)
- **ZestAccept**: Full completion acceptance (Ctrl+Enter)
- **ZestTabAccept**: Smart TAB acceptance (avoids indentation conflicts)
- **ZestDismiss**: Hide completion (Escape)
- **ZestCycleNext/Previous**: Navigate through multiple completions (Alt+Down/Up)
- **ZestAcceptNextWord/Line**: Partial acceptance (Ctrl+Right, Ctrl+Tab)

### Keyboard Shortcuts ✅
- **Ctrl+Space / Alt+/**: Trigger completion manually
- **TAB**: Smart accept (only when not indentation)
- **Ctrl+Enter**: Explicit full accept
- **Ctrl+Right**: Accept next word
- **Ctrl+Tab**: Accept next line
- **Alt+Down/Up**: Cycle through completions
- **Escape**: Dismiss completion

### Testing ✅
- Action priority verification
- Handler execution testing
- Smart TAB behavior validation
- Action promoter functionality
- Integration with completion service
- Registration verification tests

## Phase 3: Tab Handling (Week 4) ✅ COMPLETED

### Completed ✅
- [x] Implement `ZestTabBehaviorManager` for context-aware tab handling
- [x] Add advanced indentation detection logic
- [x] Create comprehensive tab behavior tests  
- [x] Test tab behavior in various contexts (empty lines, mixed indentation)
- [x] Handle edge cases and language-specific indentation
- [x] Integrate with language-specific code style settings
- [x] Create `IndentationAnalyzer` utility for context analysis
- [x] Implement `CompletionContextAnalyzer` for sophisticated decision making
- [x] Add comprehensive test coverage for all tab behavior scenarios

### Advanced Tab Handling Components ✅
- **ZestTabBehaviorManager**: Main service for intelligent tab behavior decisions
- **IndentationAnalyzer**: Utility for analyzing indentation context and patterns
- **CompletionContextAnalyzer**: Sophisticated analysis of completion content and context
- **Language-specific handling**: Support for Java, Kotlin, Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, C/C++
- **Code style integration**: Respects IntelliJ code style settings per language
- **Mixed indentation detection**: Handles files with inconsistent indentation

### Smart Decision Making ✅
- **High-confidence decisions** (80%+ confidence): Direct accept/reject based on clear indicators
- **Medium-confidence decisions** (60-80% confidence): Additional validation checks
- **Low-confidence decisions** (<60% confidence): Default to safe indentation behavior
- **Context-aware analysis**: Considers editing mode, content type, and language context
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Graceful degradation to normal TAB behavior when uncertain

### Integration ✅
- Updated `ZestTabAccept` action to use advanced behavior manager
- Seamless integration with existing completion service
- Proper service registration in plugin.xml
- Comprehensive test coverage including integration tests

## Phase 4: Keymap Management (Week 5) 🚧 IN PROGRESS

### Tasks  
- [ ] Implement `ZestKeymapSettings` service for keymap management
- [ ] Create keymap schemas (DEFAULT, ZEST_STYLE, CUSTOMIZE)
- [ ] Add keymap detection and application logic
- [ ] Create settings UI for keymap selection
- [ ] Test keymap switching and persistence  
- [ ] Add keymap conflict detection and resolution
- [ ] Implement keymap style switching without IDE restart

### In Progress 🚧
- Moving to Phase 4: Keymap Management System

## Phase 5: Advanced Features (Week 6-7) ⏳ PENDING

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement cycling through multiple completions
- [ ] Add partial acceptance (next word, next line)
- [ ] Create completion metadata and telemetry
- [ ] Add completion caching and debouncing
- [ ] Implement auto-trigger based on typing

## Phase 6: Polish and Testing (Week 8) ⏳ PENDING

### Tasks
- [ ] Comprehensive testing across different file types
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Documentation and user guides
- [ ] Plugin compatibility testing

## Current Status
- **Phase**: 4/6 (Starting)
- **Overall Progress**: 60%
- **Current Focus**: Beginning Phase 4 - Keymap Management System

## Next Steps
1. Implement ZestKeymapSettings service for managing different keymap styles
2. Create keymap schemas with different shortcut configurations
3. Add keymap detection to identify current user preferences
4. Build settings UI for easy keymap switching
5. Implement persistent keymap storage and conflict resolution
