## Current Status
- **Phase**: 2/6 (Starting)
- **Overall Progress**: 20%
- **Current Focus**: Beginning Phase 2 - Action System Implementation

## Next Steps
1. Implement ZestInlineCompletionAction base class
2. Create ZestActionPromoter for priority handling
3. Implement ZestTrigger action for manual completion requests
4. Create ZestAccept and ZestDismiss actions
5. Set up keyboard shortcuts and keymap integration
