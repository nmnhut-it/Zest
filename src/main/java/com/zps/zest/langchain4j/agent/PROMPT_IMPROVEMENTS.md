# ToolCallingAutonomousAgent Prompt Improvements

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the prompts in the ToolCallingAutonomousAgent to improve performance and provide better guidance for tool usage.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Planning Prompt (`buildPlanningPrompt`)

#### Tool Execution Order Guidelines
- **Phase 1 - Discovery**: Start with `search_code` or `find_by_name`
- **Phase 2 - Context Building**: Use `get_current_context`, `list_files_in_directory`
- **Phase 3 - Deep Analysis**: Use `read_file`, `get_class_info`, `find_methods`
- **Phase 4 - Relationship Mapping**: Use `find_relationships`, `find_callers`, etc.

#### Source vs Test Balance (NEW)
- Maintains 70% source code / 30% test code exploration ratio
- Explicit guidance to look for test files (ending with Test, Tests, Spec)
- Instructions to explore test directories parallel to source
- Emphasis on tests as documentation and usage examples

#### Best Practices Section
- Specific guidance on search query formulation
- Case sensitivity warnings for `find_by_name`
- Strategy of starting broad and narrowing down
- Relationship exploration after element discovery

#### Common Patterns
- "How does X work?" pattern (now includes test exploration)
- "Find all implementations of Y" pattern
- "What uses Z?" pattern
- All patterns updated to include test file discovery

### 2. Intelligent Exploration Prompt (`buildExplorationPrompt`)

#### Dynamic Phase Detection
- Automatically detects current exploration phase
- Provides context-aware suggestions for next steps
- Warns if discovery tools haven't been used yet

#### Source/Test Balance Monitoring (NEW)
- Real-time tracking of source vs test exploration ratio
- Alerts when ratio deviates from 70/30 target
- Suggests specific test files based on explored source files
- Shows exploration statistics (e.g., "Source files: 5, Test files: 2 (71% source)")

#### Smart Suggestions
- Lists discovered but unexplored elements
- Suggests related elements based on relationships
- Provides coverage status to help decide when to stop
- Generates test file suggestions based on naming conventions

#### Exploration Tips
- Follow breadcrumbs strategy
- Pattern recognition (Service → Repository → Controller)
- Bidirectional exploration
- Avoiding repetition
- Maintaining focus on relevance
- NEW: Emphasis on test-source pairing

### 3. Enhanced Summary Prompt (`buildSummaryPrompt`)

#### Structured Summary Guidelines
- Focus on actionability
- Hierarchical presentation
- Connected insights
- Practical code examples
- NEW: Test-informed insights

#### Comprehensive Sections
- Executive Summary (direct answer to query)
- Key Code Elements (grouped by function, notes test coverage)
- Architecture Insights (includes testing strategies)
- Implementation Details (includes test validation)
- Code Examples (from both source and tests)
- NEW: Test Coverage Insights section
- Specific Recommendations

### 4. Improved Context Tracking

#### ExplorationContext Enhancements
- Tracks explored elements and files
- Maintains discovered relationships
- Provides unexplored element suggestions
- Offers coverage adequacy checks
- Intelligent next-step recommendations
- NEW: Separate tracking for source vs test files
- NEW: Source/test ratio calculation
- NEW: Test file suggestion generation

### 5. Configuration Management

Created `AgentConfiguration.java` with:
- Centralized tuning parameters
- Tool execution priorities
- Common exploration patterns (updated with test exploration)
- Tool usage tips
- NEW: SourceTestBalance configuration
  - Target ratios (70% source, 30% test)
  - Thresholds for rebalancing
  - Test file patterns and annotations

## Benefits

1. **Better Performance**: Agents follow optimal tool execution order
2. **Reduced Redundancy**: Smart tracking prevents repeated explorations
3. **Improved Coverage**: Systematic approach ensures thorough exploration
4. **Faster Results**: Phase-based approach reaches relevant code quicker
5. **Higher Quality Summaries**: Structured format with actionable insights
6. **Complete Understanding**: 70/30 source/test balance provides full context
7. **Better Documentation**: Tests reveal expected behavior and usage patterns

## Usage

The enhanced prompts work automatically when using the ToolCallingAutonomousAgent. No code changes are required in calling code. The agent will now:

1. Start with the most efficient discovery tools
2. Progressively drill down into relevant code
3. Track what's been explored to avoid repetition
4. Maintain a healthy balance between source and test exploration
5. Provide better structured summaries with test insights
6. Know when to stop exploring based on coverage

## Source/Test Balance Feature

The agent now actively maintains a 70% source code / 30% test code exploration ratio:

- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies test files by patterns (Test.java, /test/, @Test annotations)
- **Balance Monitoring**: Tracks ratio in real-time and alerts when adjustment needed
- **Smart Suggestions**: Generates test file names based on explored source files
- **Test Insights**: Incorporates test findings into summaries for complete understanding

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- Query type classification for even more targeted strategies
- Learning from past explorations (pattern database)
- Tool performance metrics to optimize selection
- Domain-specific exploration strategies
- Test type classification (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Coverage metrics integration
