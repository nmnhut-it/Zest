# ToolCallingAutonomousAgent Prompt Improvements

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the prompts in the ToolCallingAutonomousAgent to improve performance and provide better guidance for tool usage.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Planning Prompt (`buildPlanningPrompt`)

#### Tool Execution Order Guidelines
- **Phase 1 - Discovery**: Start with `search_code` or `find_by_name`
- **Phase 2 - Context Building**: Use `get_current_context`, `list_files_in_directory`
- **Phase 3 - Deep Analysis**: Use `read_file`, `get_class_info`, `find_methods`
- **Phase 4 - Relationship Mapping**: Use `find_relationships`, `find_callers`, etc.

#### Best Practices Section
- Specific guidance on search query formulation
- Case sensitivity warnings for `find_by_name`
- Strategy of starting broad and narrowing down
- Relationship exploration after element discovery

#### Common Patterns
- "How does X work?" pattern
- "Find all implementations of Y" pattern
- "What uses Z?" pattern

### 2. Intelligent Exploration Prompt (`buildExplorationPrompt`)

#### Dynamic Phase Detection
- Automatically detects current exploration phase
- Provides context-aware suggestions for next steps
- Warns if discovery tools haven't been used yet

#### Smart Suggestions
- Lists discovered but unexplored elements
- Suggests related elements based on relationships
- Provides coverage status to help decide when to stop

#### Exploration Tips
- Follow breadcrumbs strategy
- Pattern recognition (Service → Repository → Controller)
- Bidirectional exploration
- Avoiding repetition
- Maintaining focus on relevance

### 3. Enhanced Summary Prompt (`buildSummaryPrompt`)

#### Structured Summary Guidelines
- Focus on actionability
- Hierarchical presentation
- Connected insights
- Practical code examples

#### Comprehensive Sections
- Executive Summary (direct answer to query)
- Key Code Elements (grouped by function)
- Architecture Insights
- Implementation Details
- Code Examples
- Specific Recommendations

### 4. Improved Context Tracking

#### ExplorationContext Enhancements
- Tracks explored elements and files
- Maintains discovered relationships
- Provides unexplored element suggestions
- Offers coverage adequacy checks
- Intelligent next-step recommendations

### 5. Configuration Management

Created `AgentConfiguration.java` with:
- Centralized tuning parameters
- Tool execution priorities
- Common exploration patterns
- Tool usage tips

## Benefits

1. **Better Performance**: Agents follow optimal tool execution order
2. **Reduced Redundancy**: Smart tracking prevents repeated explorations
3. **Improved Coverage**: Systematic approach ensures thorough exploration
4. **Faster Results**: Phase-based approach reaches relevant code quicker
5. **Higher Quality Summaries**: Structured format with actionable insights

## Usage

The enhanced prompts work automatically when using the ToolCallingAutonomousAgent. No code changes are required in calling code. The agent will now:

1. Start with the most efficient discovery tools
2. Progressively drill down into relevant code
3. Track what's been explored to avoid repetition
4. Provide better structured summaries
5. Know when to stop exploring based on coverage

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- Query type classification for even more targeted strategies
- Learning from past explorations (pattern database)
- Tool performance metrics to optimize selection
- Domain-specific exploration strategies
