# Code Health NPE Fix Summary

## Issue
The original implementation used `JEditorPane` with HTML content that caused a `NullPointerException` in the Swing HTML parser when encountering certain CSS properties that couldn't be parsed.

## Root Cause
The error occurred at:
```
javax.swing.text.html.CSS$CssValue.parseCssValue(String)
```
The HTML parser encountered CSS properties (like `border-radius`, `float`) that it couldn't handle, causing a null converter and subsequent NPE.

## Solution
Replaced the HTML-based report dialog with a simpler, more robust implementation using:

1. **JTabbedPane** - For organizing content into tabs
2. **JBTextArea** - For displaying plain text reports
3. **JButton** - For copy actions with proper action listeners

## Benefits of New Approach

1. **No HTML Parsing** - Eliminates NPE risk from CSS parsing
2. **Better Performance** - Plain text rendering is faster
3. **More Maintainable** - No complex CSS/HTML to debug
4. **Better UX** - Tabbed interface organizes information better
5. **Consistent Look** - Uses IntelliJ's native UI components

## New UI Structure

```
Code Health Report Dialog
├── Summary Tab
│   └── Overview statistics and top issues
├── Issues by Method Tab
│   └── Detailed issues per method with copy button
└── Suggested Actions Tab
    └── Grouped fix prompts by issue type
```

The fix maintains all functionality while being more reliable and user-friendly.
