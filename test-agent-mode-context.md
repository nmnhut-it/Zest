# Testing Agent Mode Context Enhancement

## Test Cases

### 1. JavaScript Function Extraction
Create a test JavaScript file with various function patterns and verify that full implementations are extracted.

### 2. Java Method Extraction with PSI
Create a test Java file and verify that PSI is used to extract complete method implementations.

### 3. Context Formatting
Verify that the prompt builder formats the context properly with:
- Full function implementations (not just signatures)
- Git commit details with file changes
- Proper code highlighting

## Implementation Summary

We've successfully improved the Agent Mode Context Enhancement:

1. **Enhanced `FileService.java`**:
   - Added `extractFullFunctionImplementation()` method for JavaScript/TypeScript
   - Added `findFunctionsInJavaFile()` method using PSI for Java files
   - Added fallback text-based parsing for Java files
   - Updated `findCocosClassMethods()` to extract full implementations
   - Updated `findAnonymousFunctions()` to extract full implementations

2. **Enhanced `OpenWebUIAgentModePromptBuilder.java`**:
   - Improved `formatCodeContext()` to show full function implementations
   - Improved `formatGitContext()` to show commit details and file changes
   - Added truncation for very large implementations (>1500 chars)

3. **Key Improvements**:
   - Complete function bodies are now extracted instead of just signatures
   - Proper brace matching handles nested structures
   - Arrow functions with expression bodies are handled correctly
   - Java files use PSI when available for accurate parsing
   - Context formatting is more detailed and useful

## Testing the Implementation

To test this in your IDE:

1. Open a project with mixed JavaScript and Java files
2. Use Agent Mode and ask about a specific function
3. Check the IDE logs (with debug enabled) to see the enhanced context
4. Verify that full function implementations are included in the prompt

The assistant should now receive much more detailed context about the code, making it more effective at understanding and modifying your codebase.
